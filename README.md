## Core Java Project - Eclipse

This project was first exploration to Java.  Here we build a console project simply to practice building classes, methods, polymorphism, abstraction, implementing interfaces, and OOP. We were not authorized to use any front end technologies, so please excuse the application length and complexity. 

This entire project was test driven development.

    
## Instructions for use 

Clone project from github, open project 'master Branch' - navigate to directory once cloned - run 'gradle eclipse' on this file, and import into Eclipse. Then, run application as Java project, and use the console to navigate.

Select 1 after pressing any key, and continue as a medical director. Here you will be able to see the work flow of the project.

### What I really like?

We had a 48 hour deadline to complete this task, thus there are a lot of things 
that could be optimized in the future. I really enjoy Java! I enjoyed learning how methods, classes, objects, abstractions, and interfaces work together as this is the most exciting piece of development for me personally.
