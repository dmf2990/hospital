This is our first console project to learn OOP in java. PLEASE SEE DEV BRANCH AND DEV BRANCH README.
The application was a bit lengthy due to the nature of the project, however the focal point of this project was setting up the classes
Concepts of abstraction, interfaces, polymorphism, and adding/removing/manipulating statistics of items into hashmaps were primary components. 
In this program we had a collection of patients in a hospital.  These patients had baseline vitals.  
From here healthcare workers can  draw the patients blood to affect the patients health, or 'treat' the patient, they can also admit new patients, and release existing patients from hashmap.

This programs was entirely test driven using TDD.
