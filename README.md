This project was our exploration to Java.  Here we build a console project simply to practice abstraction, implementing interfaces, and OOP.
This entire project was test driven. 
We had a 48 hour deadline to complete this task, thus there are a lot of things 
that could be optimized. We had to use quite a few switch cases because we were not allowed to use any front end technologies.
